# Vault Filters Rune Addon

An addon for [Vault Filters](https://github.com/Odgug/Vault-Filters) that adds new filter attributes for **Boss Runes** in Vault Hunters. This enables more advanced filtering, sorting, and searching of runes based on their internal properties.

---

## Features

- **New Filter Attributes** for Boss Runes:
  - **Modifier**: Filter by the modifier a rune provides.
  - **Gives Item**: Filter by the item the rune grants.
  - **Gear Rarity**: Filter by the rarity of gear a rune provides.
  - **Booster Pack Type**: Filter by the type of card/booster pack the rune gives.
  - **Inscription Type**: Filter by the type of inscription.

- **Seamless Integration** with Vault Filters UI.

- **Safe Multiplayer Handling**:  
  If the server does not have this addon, or has the wrong version, all addon features are disabled on the client, and users are clearly notified. This prevents crashes and exploits.

---

## Project Status

**This addon will only be supported as long as Vault Filters does not implement boss rune attribute filtering natively. If Vault Filters adds these features, this addon will be deprecated.**
